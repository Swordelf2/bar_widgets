9 - arty

I - com
I+Shift - repairers/reclaimers
U+Shift - Add BP to selection

P+Shift - Guard AND Guard last builder

L+Alt - t1 con
K+Alt - t2 con
J+Alt - consul and shit





## Later

# TODO
Alt-P to always center on cam even from overview

Skip all commands except current one

Cancel/Skip all orders except current one
Double tap to also cancel queued commands

Probably build into grid menu Alt + build unit puts factory on repeat
Remove delay on skip_last_command
Test everything in multiplyaer game vs AI



# Ideas for later

Double tap to also cancel queued commands
Last builder - set only when given an order
Issuing a non-shift command sets Repeat Off (TO NON FACTORIES).
Also cancelling all commands and Stop sets Repeat to off
Rebind Repeat to Shift+X as it's easier when issuing orders with Shift (maybe shift+-)

Create a panic button - Wait all builders and factories
Create a STRONGER panic button - Also wait all energy consuming fighting units

Watch teddy's or pro_randy's replays

Shift+X - clear selection on press, add to selection on repeat ("r")
Use gatherwait (only before a fight command)
So go back with Ctrl, then queue up gatherwait then queue up Fight command forward

Free  up `M` in build keys (as we never need to press it)

WTF is range display of corconfig
