## Later

# TODO
Use Shift+Alt commands

How to use rez bots

scenario: select a builder, queue up commands and guard factory
then select BP around, cancel all their commands Shift+8 and then Shift+y
But then all the builders commands get canceled as well


Cancel/Skip all orders except current one
Double tap to also cancel queued commands

Probably build into grid menu Alt + build unit puts factory on repeat
Remove delay on skip_last_command
Test everything in multiplyaer game vs AI



# Ideas for later

Very cool new way to select units, possibly using a combination of 2
consecutive keys

Alt-P to always center on cam even from overview

Double tap to also cancel queued commands
Last builder - set only when given an order
Issuing a non-shift command sets Repeat Off (TO NON FACTORIES).
Rebind Repeat to Shift+X as it's easier when issuing orders with Shift (maybe shift+-)

Create a panic button - Wait all builders and factories
Create a STRONGER panic button - Also wait all energy consuming fighting units

Watch teddy's or pro_randy's replays

Shift+X - clear selection on press, add to selection on repeat ("r")
Use gatherwait (only before a fight command)
So go back with Ctrl, then queue up gatherwait then queue up Fight command forward

Free  up `M` in build keys (as we never need to press it)
